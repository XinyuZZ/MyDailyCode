EE3206 Test 1

Student Name: ZHU Xinyu
Student ID: 57017355

================================================================================

This template has two classes: TestOneXXXXXXXX and Student.

TestOneXXXXXXXX is the main class. You should rename it by entering your student ID to replace
the string XXXXXXXX.

Student is an immutable class representing a student. It has a CSV string that contains the
information of 1000 students.

You are asked to implement all methods specified below:
(1) createList
(2) function1
(3) function2

You should refer to the detailed requirements written in each method.

You should NOT modify any other parts of this template, except importing classes.

You should NOT use any external libraries other than the JDK.

Below are the expected output from the main method:

=== Creating a student list: ===
1000 students have been created.

=== Math Scores ===
MALE : 68.73(avg) 14.34(stdev)
FEMALE : 63.63(avg) 15.48(stdev)

=== Math Scores / Parental Education Level (sorted) ===

EE3206 Test 1

Student Name: ZHU Xinyu
Student ID: 57017355

================================================================================

This template has two classes: TestOneXXXXXXXX and Student.

TestOneXXXXXXXX is the main class. You should rename it by entering your student ID to replace
the string XXXXXXXX.

Student is an immutable class representing a student. It has a CSV string that contains the
information of 1000 students.

You are asked to implement all methods specified below:
(1) createList
(2) function1
(3) function2

You should refer to the detailed requirements written in each method.

You should NOT modify any other parts of this template, except importing classes.

You should NOT use any external libraries other than the JDK.

Below are the expected output from the main method:

=== Creating a student list: ===
1000 students have been created.

=== Math Scores ===
MALE : 68.73(avg) 14.34(stdev)
FEMALE : 63.63(avg) 15.48(stdev)

=== Math Scores / Parental Education Level (sorted) ===
